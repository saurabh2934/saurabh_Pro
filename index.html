                    The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ -/ TAHJ mə-HAHL, TAHZH -⁠, Hindi: [taːdʒ ˈmɛɦ(ɛ)l]; lit. 'Crown of the Palace') is
                    an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. It was commissioned
                    in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it
                    also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which
                    includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
                    
                    Construction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five
                    years. The first ceremony held at the mausoleum was an observance by Shah Jahan, on 6 February 1643, of the 12th
                    anniversary of the death of Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in
                    1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹5 million, which in 2023 would be approximately ₹35 billion (US$77.8
                    million).
                    
                    The building complex incorporates the design traditions of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. It employs symmetrical
                    constructions with the usage of various shapes and symbols. While the mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid
                    with semi-precious stones, red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex similar to the Mughal era buildings
                    of the time. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of
                    architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.
                    
                    The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Islamic art in India and
                    one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded as one of the best examples of
                    Mughal architecture and a symbol of Indian history. The Taj Mahal is a major tourist attraction and attracts more than
                    five million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World initiative.

                    The Great Pyramid of Giza[a] is the largest Egyptian pyramid. It served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during
                    the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Built c. 2600 BC,[3] over a period of about 26 years,[4] the pyramid is the
                    oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and the only wonder that has remained largely intact. It is the most
                    famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its
                    Necropolis".[5] It is situated at the northeastern end of the line of the three main pyramids at Giza.
                    
                    Initially standing at 146.6 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the world's tallest human-made structure for more
                    than 3,800 years. Over time, most of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height
                    to the current 138.5 metres (454.4 ft); what is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be
                    about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which
                    includes an internal hillock.[6] The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 royal cubits (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base
                    length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of ⁠5+

                    2
                    ⁠ palms (a slope of 51°50'40").
                    
                    The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks, weighing 6 million tonnes in total. The
                    majority of the stones are not uniform in size or shape, and are only roughly dressed.[7] The outside layers were bound
                    together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used for its construction. Other blocks were
                    imported by boat on the Nile: white limestone from Tura for the casing, and blocks of granite from Aswan, weighing up to
                    80 tonnes, for the "King's Chamber" structure.[8]
                    
                    There are three known chambers inside of the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid
                    was built, but remained unfinished. The so-called[9] Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, which contain a granite
                    sarcophagus, are above ground, within the pyramid structure. Hemiunu, Khufu's vizier, is believed by some to be the
                    architect of the Great Pyramid.[10] Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact
                    construction techniques, but, as is the case for other such structures, there is no definite consensus.

                The Colosseum (/ˌkɒləˈsiːəm/ KOL-ə-SEE-əm; Italian: Colosseo [kolosˈsɛːo]) is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre
                of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is
                still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age. Construction began under the Emperor Vespasian
                (r. 69–79 AD) in 72[1] and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus (r. 79–81).[2] Further
                modifications were made during the reign of Domitian (r. 81–96).[3] The three emperors who were patrons of the work are
                known as the Flavian dynasty, and the amphitheatre was named the Flavian Amphitheatre (Latin: Amphitheatrum Flavium;
                Italian: Anfiteatro Flavio [aɱfiteˈaːtro ˈflaːvjo]) by later classicists and archaeologists for its association with
                their family name (Flavius).
                
                The Colosseum is built of travertine limestone, tuff (volcanic rock), and brick-faced concrete. It could hold an
                estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators at various points in its history,[4][5] having an average audience of some
                65,000;[6] it was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments
                of famous battles, dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles. The building ceased to be used for
                entertainment in the early medieval era. It was later reused for such purposes as housing, workshops, quarters for a
                religious order, a fortress, a quarry, and a Christian shrine.
                
                Although substantially ruined by earthquakes and stone robbers taking spolia, the Colosseum is still a renowned symbol
                of Imperial Rome and was listed as one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7] It is one of Rome's most popular tourist
                attractions and has links to the Catholic Church, as each Good Friday the Pope leads a torchlit "Way of the Cross"
                procession that starts in the area around the Colosseum.[8] The Colosseum is depicted on the Italian version of the 5
                euro cent coin.

                    Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco
                    statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian
                    engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida
                    sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26
                    ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5]
                    Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe
                    in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed
                    to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.
                    
                    The statue weighs 635 metric tons (625 long, 700 short tons), and is located at the peak of the 700-metre (2,300 ft)
                    Corcovado mountain in the Tijuca National Park overlooking the city of Rio de Janeiro. This statue is the largest Art
                    Deco–style sculpture in the world.[6] A symbol of Christianity around the world, the statue has also become a cultural
                    icon of both Rio de Janeiro and Brazil and was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World.[7]

                    The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten
                    thousand li long wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient
                    Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls
                    were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC),
                    the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained
                    multiple stretches of border walls. The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).
                    
                    Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on
                    goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and
                    emigration.[6] Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
                    watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact
                    that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
                    
                    The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Liaodong in the
                    east to Lop Lake in the west, from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River (Taohe) in the south;
                    along an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe; spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in
                    total.[7][3] Today, the defensive system of the Great Wall is generally recognized as one of the most impressive
                    architectural feats in history.[8]

                    Petra (Arabic: ٱلْبَتْراء, romanized: Al-Batrāʾ; ‹See Tfd›Greek: Πέτρα, "Rock"), originally known to its inhabitants as
                    Raqmu (Nabataean: 𐢛𐢚𐢒‎ or 𐢛𐢚𐢓𐢈‎, *Raqēmō),[3][4] is a historic and archaeological city in southern Jordan. Famous
                    for its rock-cut architecture and water conduit systems, Petra is also called the "Rose City" because of the colour of
                    the sandstone from which it is carved.[5] The city is one of the New 7 Wonders of the World and a UNESCO World Heritage
                    Site.[6]
                    
                    The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[7] and was settled by the Nabataeans, a nomadic Arab
                    people, in the 4th century BC. Petra would later become the capital city of the Nabataean Kingdom in the second century
                    BC.[7][8] The Nabataeans invested in Petra's proximity to the incense trade routes by establishing it as a major
                    regional trading hub, which gained them considerable revenue.[7][9] Unlike their enemies, the Nabataeans were accustomed
                    to living in the barren deserts and thus were able to defend their kingdom. They were particularly skillful in
                    agriculture, stone carving, and rainwater harvesting.
                    
                    Petra flourished in the 1st century AD, when its Al-Khazneh structure, possibly the mausoleum of Nabataean king Aretas
                    IV, was constructed, and its population peaked at an estimated 20,000 inhabitants.[10] Nabataea fell to the Romans in
                    106 AD, who annexed and renamed it as Arabia Petraea.[11] Petra's importance declined as sea trade routes emerged, and
                    after an earthquake in 363 destroyed many structures. In the Byzantine era, several Christian churches were built, but
                    the city continued to decline and, by the early Islamic era, it was abandoned except for a handful of nomads. It
                    remained unknown to the western world until 1812, when Swiss traveller Johann Ludwig Burckhardt rediscovered it.[12]
                    
                    UNESCO has described Petra as "one of the most precious cultural properties of man's cultural heritage".[13] Petra is a
                    symbol of Jordan, as well as Jordan's most-visited tourist attraction. Visitor numbers reach close to a million tourists
                    every year.[14]

                    Machu Picchu[a] is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru on a mountain ridge at
                    2,430 meters (7,970 ft).[9] Often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas",[10] it is the most familiar icon of the
                    Inca Empire. It is located in the Machupicchu District within the Urubamba Province[11] above the Sacred Valley, which
                    is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of the city of Cusco. The Urubamba River flows past it, cutting through the
                    Cordillera and creating a canyon with a subtropical mountain climate.[12]
                    
                    The Inca civilization had no written language and following the first encounter by the Spanish soldier Baltasar Ocampo,
                    no Europeans are recorded to have visited the site from the late 16th century until the 19th century. As far as
                    historical knowledge extends, there are no existing written records detailing the site during its period of active use.
                    The leading theory is that Machu Picchu was a private city for Incan royalty. The names of the buildings, their supposed
                    uses, and their inhabitants, are the product of modern archaeologists based on physical evidence, including tombs at the
                    site. Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its three primary structures
                    are the Temple of the Sun, the Temple of the Three Windows, and the Intihuatana. From 1929 to 1971, Machu Picchu
                    underwent extensive restoration and conservation work, including structural stabilization and artifact excavation,
                    driven by government initiatives and research expeditions.[13] Most recent archaeologists believe that Machu Picchu was
                    constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472). The Inca built the estate around 1450 but abandoned
                    it a century later, at the time of the Spanish conquest. According to the new AMS radiocarbon dating, it was occupied
                    from c. 1420–1532.[14] Historical research published in 2022 claims that the site was probably called Huayna Picchu by
                    the Inca people themselves, as it exists on the smaller peak of the same name.[15][16]
                    
                    Machu Picchu was declared a Peruvian Historic Sanctuary in 1982 and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983.[9] In 2007,
                    Machu Picchu was voted one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a worldwide internet poll.[17]
